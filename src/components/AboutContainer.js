Influenced by global architecture and modern art, they shared similar design aesthetics: bold colors, clean lines, and effortless silhouettes. They often half-joked about starting a line together some day, and nearly 5 years after graduating their friendship turned into a creative partnership as the co-founders of Dooz.</p>
